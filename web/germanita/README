Simple Rdio Web Playback Example

This aims to be a very simple example of using the Rdio web playback API.

The main HTML file is hello.html. It includes a very very simple player UI.

The main JavaScript file is hello.js. It initializes the playback API SWF
and connects the UI components from hello.html to the SWF.

jQuery and SWFObject are used to make cross-browser compatibility easy.


The example requires a playback token to work. One for 'localhost' is included
in token.js but to run the example on a server you'll have to generate your
own. Look in token.js for more information on how to do that.
